# Mac Setup
A great initial install setup for mac

## Apple Store
* microsoft remote desktop
* wunderlist

## Homebrew
* git
* yarn
* wget 
* nvm - watch for post install instructions on the prompt!
* htop
* macvim
* python
* bash-git-prompt - shows git status right in the bash prompt *(requires post-install configuration)*
* watchman

## Direct Download
* virtualbox
* scroll reverser - to allow the mouse scroll wheel and touch-pad scrolling to go in separate directions
* slack
* Karabiner and Karabiner Elements - to remap capslock to esc
* github desktop
* Pinta - good, simple, cross-platform, image editor
* grandperspective - disk space analysis tool (like "windirstat")
* textwrangler
* keepassX
* dropbox
* VimR
* Jetbrains tools
  * WebStorm
  * DataGrip
  * IntelliJ
* VSCode
* Office or LibreOffice
* Fork - great git gui, almost as good as gitExtensions
* Chrome
* iTerm2 - an alternative terminal 

## Setup
* Enable key repeats: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
* Drag applications folder into dock for a windows-like start menu experience
* tweak all the things
* tune the scroll reverser to start on startup and only reverse the mouse
* https://github.com/lysyi3m/osx-terminal-themes has some good themes for the terminal
* In mac's system settings set the caps lock to no-action, and the key repeat delay to nearly the shortest option, and the key repeat itself as fast as possible
* Use Karabiner-Elements to set the caps lock key to be an esc key
